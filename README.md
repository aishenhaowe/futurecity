# Future City
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aishenhaowe/futurecity.png)](https://travis-ci.org/aishenhaowe/futurecity)

We want to create a e2e(endpoint to endpoint) solution about IOT. A server, a lot of endpoints(devices), and app are needed for us.

As usual, there's a six layer's module for IOT server, but the NB-IoT changed this, a IOT platform will be supplied, and all of the devices can have a access to it. Each of the device can be recongnized as a resource, and we can use a uri to find and use them.

// TODO: How to use this platform should be confirmed
